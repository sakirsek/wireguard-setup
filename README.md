# WireGuard EC2 Setup Script

üöÄ **Automated WireGuard VPN setup script for AWS EC2 with SOCKS5 proxy support.**  
This script installs, configures, and enables WireGuard VPN on an AWS EC2 instance with automatic firewall and network settings. It also sets up a SOCKS5 proxy using Dante server for additional flexibility.

## üìå Features
- Installs WireGuard, Dante server, and required dependencies
- Automatically detects network interface
- Configures IP forwarding and firewall rules
- Generates secure keys for the server and client
- Provides a ready-to-use WireGuard client configuration
- Outputs the WireGuard configuration file in the terminal for easy copying and usage
- Sets up a SOCKS5 proxy server for additional connectivity options

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Usage

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sakirsek/wireguard-setup.git
   cd wireguard-setup
   ```

2. **Make the script executable**:
   ```bash
   chmod +x setup.sh
   ```

3. **Run the script**:
   ```bash
   sudo ./setup.sh
   ```

4. **Open the WireGuard port on AWS EC2 Security Group**:
   - Go to **AWS Management Console** ‚Üí **EC2** ‚Üí **Security Groups**.
   - Find the security group associated with your EC2 instance.
   - Add an **inbound rule** to allow **UDP traffic on port 51820** (or the port you configured in the script).
   - Set the source as **0.0.0.0/0** (or restrict it to your specific IPs).

5. **Configure the SOCKS5 Proxy**:
   - The script installs and configures **Dante** as a SOCKS5 proxy server.
   - The proxy runs on **port 1080**.
   - By default, it allows unauthenticated connections. Adjust `/etc/danted.conf` for custom authentication settings.
   - Restart the proxy if needed:
     ```bash
     sudo systemctl restart danted
     ```

6. **Copy and use the client configuration**:
   - The script will generate a WireGuard configuration for the client and display it in the terminal.
   - Copy the configuration output and save it as `client.conf`.
   - Import `client.conf` into your WireGuard client to establish a connection.
